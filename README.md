# Simple Math Operation Program

This is a simple Python program that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on their input. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and a mathematical operation, performs the specified operation, and then displays the result.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-math-operation-program.git


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
cd simple-math-operation-program


### Usage

1. **Run the Program**
python main.py


2. **Follow the Prompts**

The program will prompt you to enter two numbers and a mathematical operation. Enter the required values and the program will display the result.

Example interaction:
Enter the first number: 10 Enter the second number: 5 Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): + 10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0


## Features

- Supports basic mathematical operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid operations.
